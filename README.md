Graphical elliptical orbit simulator written in LWJGL and OpenGL

Designed for A-Level students to achieve a more intuitive understanding of Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and how these impact the shape of a planet's orbit. 
Can randomly generate solar systems, and modify the properties of each of the planets by clicking on them.
